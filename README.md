 #INTRODUCTION

  This marks my initial attempt at data visualization with minimal guidance. 

  I sourced this employee dataset from Kaggle. After importing the dataset into Excel, I undertook the following steps:

   - Duplicated the data sheet,
   - Adjusted row and column sizes automatically, 
   - Applied filters to each column to assess the data, 
   - Identify any blanks or null values, 
   - And verified the column names. 
     
  "This dataset provides comprehensive information about the company's workforce, encompassing details about employees'  backgrounds, work history, 
    demographics, and employment-related factors. The dataset has been anonymized to protect  privacy while offering valuable insights into the workforce." 

   The dataset was relatively clean. 

  Several questions were formulated and I attempted to address them: 

  Examining diversity and inclusion. 
  Analyzing the distribution of educational qualifications among employees. 
  Investigating how the length of service (joining year) varies across different cities. 
  Exploring the correlation between payment tier and experience in the current domain. 
  Identifying patterns in employee leave behavior. 

  I extracted four pivot tables and created four data graphs. 
 Finally, I developed a comprehensive dashboard featuring four  data graphs and three slicers (Everbenched, Age, PaymentTier) to address the questions and more.  

                   DASHBOARD ANALYSIS 

  Diversity and inclusion: Based on my dashboard, the representation of both genders, age groups, and educational levels appears equitable and above average. 
However, there are notable disparities, particularly in Payment Tier 2 for male employees holding master's degrees and 
Payment Tier 3 for female employees with bachelor's degrees. 

  Distribution of educational qualifications among employees: Bachelor's degrees are the most prevalent, with a total of 3,601 employees from 2012 to 2018.
Master's degrees come in second with 873 employees in total, followed by Ph.D. holders with 179 employees. 
Although the distribution may seem skewed, a significant number of employees with bachelor's degrees fall within the age range of 22 to 34, 
suggesting potential pursuit of higher qualifications. 

  Variation in length of service (joining year) across different cities: Bangalore has the highest number of employees from 2012 to 2018, followed by New Delhi and Pune. 
Bangalore consistently attracted over 300 employees from 2012 to 2017, decreasing to 203 in 2018 but still exceeding the combined count of New Delhi and Pune in 2018. 
New Delhi and Pune exhibited relatively lower numbers, with only one peak year eachâ€”474 employees in 2017 for New Delhi and 333 employees in 2015 for Pune. 
Further investigation may shed light on the underlying reasons for these trends, aiding HR understanding. 

Correlation between payment tier and experience in the current domain: 
Indeed, a correlation exists. Employees with more experience in the current domain tend to have higher payment tiers.
